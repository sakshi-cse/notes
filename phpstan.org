Setting up PHPStan on Ubuntu 22.04 involves a series of steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you install and configure PHPStan on your Ubuntu 22.04 system:

Install PHP:

Ensure that PHP is installed on your system. You can install it using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php
Verify the installation:

bash
Copy code
php -v
Install Composer:

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP and is used to install PHPStan. Run the following commands to install Composer:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install curl php-cli unzip
bash
Copy code
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
Verify the Composer installation:

bash
Copy code
composer --version
Navigate to your PHP project:

Change your working directory to the root of your PHP project:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project
Create a composer.json file:

If you don't already have a composer.json file, create one in your project's root. Here's a basic example:

json
Copy code
{
    "require-dev": {
        "phpstan/phpstan": "^1.0"
    }
}
Save the file.

Install PHPStan using Composer:

Run the following command to install PHPStan and its dependencies:

bash
Copy code
composer install
This will create a vendor directory in your project containing PHPStan and its dependencies.

Run PHPStan:

Once the installation is complete, you can run PHPStan to analyze your code:

bash
Copy code
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
This will analyze your code and report any potential issues.

Configure PHPStan (Optional):

Create a phpstan.neon configuration file in your project directory to customize PHPStan's behavior. For example:

ini
Copy code
parameters:
    level: 7
    paths:
        - src
Adjust the configuration based on your project structure and requirements.
